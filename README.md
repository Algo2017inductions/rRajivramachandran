#Spider
Summer induction 2017
## The beginning
On the 23rd of May 2017, the semester exams caame to a close and I was looking forward to the summer vacations. Moreover I was excited to go through the induction process of **Team Spider** and ultimately become a member.
## Who I am?
I am _Rajiv Ramachandran_ from Chennai. I love to code, write short stories and play sports like football and cricket. The schools I have been to were:
*  St. Michaels Academy - class LKG to 6
*  Arsha Vidya Mandir - class 7 to 10
*  The Hindu Senior - class 11 to 12

I have been exposed to various cultures at these schools and right now at Nit I feel that there is a mix of these 3 diverse cultures that I have experienced. I am the kind of person who talks a lot at certain points in time but am mostly quiet. Many think I hate company but that is not true. 
I hold this policy close to my heart and wish to always pursue it
